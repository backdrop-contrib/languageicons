Description
-----------
This module provides icons for language links, both for the Language switcher
block and (optionally) for node links.


Installation
------------
Download and place the recommended version of the module in your website's
modules directory, go to the **Functionality** page (`/admin/modules`) and
enable the **Language Icons** module.

Alternatively, just run on CLI:
```
brush -y en languageicons
```


Configuration
-------------
1. Go to Structure > Layouts > choose layout > Manage Blocks and add `Language
switcher` block.

2. Go to Configuration > Regional and Language > Languages > Language Icons and
set desired settings. You can place flags before or after the language link or
choose to only display the language flag without the language name (pick
"Replace link" under icon placement to do so). There are some other options so
make sure to check it out.
